            <p>My name is Shane and I'm a twenty nine year old future web developer. I'm currently living in Vancouver and have been for the last three years. I'm original from a small village in the west of Ireland. I have been in Ireland for most of my life until i made the move to San Francisco six years ago. Since then I have found great pleasure in travelling and have no intensions of stopping anytime soon. </p>

            <p>I decided to persue a career in web development because it's something I found very intersesting and challenging at the same time. I find great pleasure in problem solving and learning new things in a fast-paced enviroment. </p>
